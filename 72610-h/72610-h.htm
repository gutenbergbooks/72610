<h3><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were to be great times
at Mr. Lee’s house during the
Christmas Holidays. Frank
and Flora had long looked
forward to this season, for
they expected to enjoy themselves
more than ever before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Their two cousins, Henry
and Sarah Vernon, were to
spend a week with them; and
this alone would have made
them very happy. Besides
this, Christmas was to be celebrated
in a manner worthy
of the occasion.</p>

<p>The windows of the parlor
and sitting room had been
dressed with evergreen, and
looked very pretty. And the
day before Christmas, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Flora wanted to enter the
parlor, she found the doors
were all locked. At first she
did not know what to make
of this, for she had never
known the doors to be fastened
before.</p>

<p>She was going to ask her
mother why the doors were
locked, when she happened
to think that her father and
mother might want to surprise
the children in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
manner, and she decided not
to say any thing about the
matter.</p>

<p>Henry and Sarah came in
the noon train, and their
cousins were very glad to see
them. They lived in the city,
and had a great deal to say
about the fine things at home.
Then Frank had to tell about
his voyage down the river on
a raft. The city cousins felt a
deep interest in this story, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
they had heard their parents
speak of it.</p>

<p>Flora had no story to tell,
and seemed to be thrown into
the shade by the fine talk of
her city cousins, and the great
doings of her brother Frank.
But she was thinking of something
all the time—something
that was a great deal better
than fine talk, or even sailing
on the river.</p>

<p>She had a great plan in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
head. She had been thinking
of it for two or three weeks.
Indeed, she had been so kind
of sober while she thought,
that her parents feared she
might be sick. She was almost
always laughing, and
was as fond of play as any
little girl you ever saw.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, therefore,
that her father and mother
thought she must be sick, for
this plan had made a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
change in her,—just as when
boys and girls become men
and women, and have a great
many things to think about,
they have to stop playing, and
do not laugh half so much as
when they were children.</p>

<p>After dinner, the children
all met in the play room. It
was a nice little chamber up
stairs, where Frank and Flora
kept their playthings, and
where they played in stormy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
weather. I dare say all my
little readers would have enjoyed
a visit to this room, for
it was a perfect museum of
playthings.</p>

<p>In one corner there was a
complete doll’s house. It is
true, there was but one room
in Miss Dolly’s mansion, but
it had ever so many fine
things in it.</p>

<p>It was about a yard square.
Two sides of the room were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
formed of the two sides of
the chamber, while the other
two were made of a kind of
fence, about six inches high.</p>

<p>This little chamber had a
carpet of its own—and a
very pretty carpet it was, too.
I believe it was a piece of
drab cashmere, with a handsome
figure on it; and it
looked just like a carpet.</p>

<p>In one corner stood the
bed. It was nicely made up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
with a clean white spread,
and real sheets and pillows.
The bedstead was made of
rosewood, and the corners
were carved; and if you had
seen it, you would have said
it was the prettiest one in the
world.</p>

<p>There was a centre table
in the middle of the room,
on which were placed two or
three of the tiniest books you
ever saw. One of them was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
called “A Picture of London.”
It was given to Flora by her
friend Mr. Bigelow, a bookseller
in the city. Another
was “The Life of Tom Thumb.”
Neither of these books was
more than an inch square;
and they were just big enough
for the little centre table.</p>

<p>Six tiny chairs stood around
the room, besides two sofas,
and a rocking chair. Near
the bed was a handsome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
stuffed arm-chair, in which
Miss Dolly herself was seated.</p>

<p>Miss Dolly was a very pretty
young lady. She had a
wax head, with glass eyes,
and real hair. She was
clothed in a white muslin
dress, trimmed with satin ribbon.
It was rather a cool
dress for Christmas; but I
suppose Flora thought she
ought to look like a bride at
this time, though it was winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Her cousin Sarah had never
seen Miss Dolly or her mansion
house before, and she
was so pleased that she
danced with delight. She
had to take up Miss Dolly
herself, and examine every
article of her dress. Then
she picked up every article
in the room and looked at
it. Not content with this,
the bed had to be pulled to
pieces, and re-made, so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
she could see every part
of it.</p>

<p>Henry Vernon, being a boy,
was, of course, <em>above</em> taking
an interest in dollies and
baby-houses. But he could
not help being pleased with
the pretty room in which
Miss Dolly lived. He looked
at the bed, the sofas, and the
chairs, and said some smart
things about dolls and baby-houses
in general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
He then turned his attention
to the rocking-horse, the
tin steamboat, and other wonderful
things that were in the
play room. Frank showed
him all the toys, hoops, rattles,
and “things” he had. By the
time he had finished, and the
girls had put Miss Dolly’s
room to rights, Flora called
the meeting to order by hinting
that she had something
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
All were ready to hear her;
but poor Flora was so wild
over her great plan, that she
could hardly say what she
wished. She had been thinking
of something for a long
time, and she almost trembled
for fear the others would not
like her plan.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I have
been thinking about these three
weeks?” said she, her pretty
face red with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“How should we know?”
replied Henry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Was it about a sleigh
ride?” asked Sarah.</p>

<p>“No; nothing of that kind.”</p>

<p>“A Christmas tree?”</p>

<p>“No; guess again.”</p>

<p>“About having a party?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“When you guess right, I’ll
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it about a rag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
baby?” said Henry, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>They all guessed round several
times, but none of them
guessed right. By this time
Flora was calm enough to
unfold her great plan.</p>

<p>“Do you know there is a
poor woman in <span class="lock">Riverdale—”</span></p>

<p>“Lots of them,” put in
Henry.</p>

<p>“But there is one poor woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
in Riverdale that I want
to tell you about. She is a
widow—that means that she
hasn’t got any body to take
care of her.”</p>

<p>Henry burst out in a hearty
laugh, which quite surprised
poor Flora; and she wondered
what she had said that was so
funny.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we don’t
know what a widow is?” asked
Henry, who was a city boy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and rather smart. “Besides,
a widow isn’t a woman that
hasn’t got any one to take
care of her.”</p>

<p>“No one but David, I mean,”
added Flora, who felt that she
had made a mistake.</p>

<p>“Who is David?” said
Sarah.</p>

<p>“He is the poor widow’s
son; and he is a real nice
boy. He sells newspapers
and gets money for his poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
mother; and she thinks there
is not another boy like David
in the world.”</p>

<p>“Does she, indeed! What
a funny mother she must be,
to be sure!” laughed Henry.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Flora; “there
comes my mother, and I don’t
want her to know any thing
about it yet.”</p>

<p>So they all went to playing
with Dolly and the rocking-horse;
but Mrs. Lee did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
stop but a moment. She only
came in to see what the children
were about; for they
laughed so loud, she was
afraid they were doing some
mischief.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> as soon as Mrs. Lee
had left the room, the little
party gathered round Flora
again to find out what she
had been thinking about.
They all wanted to know.
Even Henry, who talked so
big, and felt so big, was just
as eager as Sarah and Frank.</p>

<p>“David White—that’s the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
poor widow’s son—earns lots
of money by selling papers.
But his mother is very poor,”
continued Flora.</p>

<p>“You told us that before,”
said Henry.</p>

<p>“Dear me! so I did. Well—his
mother is very poor.”</p>

<p>“That’s three times you
have said it.”</p>

<p>“What ails me?” laughed
Flora. “I believe I can’t say
what I wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
“Try again, then,” added
Sarah.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. White—that’s
the poor widow’s name—as
she is very <span class="lock">poor——”</span></p>

<p>The children all laughed
then till their sides ached,
and Master Henry had nearly
smashed Miss Dolly’s quarters
all to pieces, he was so much
amused because Flora said
the same thing so many
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
“Never mind him,” said
Sarah. “Now go on, Flora.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was just going to
say that Mrs. White was very
<span class="lock">poor——”</span></p>

<p>“You <em>did</em> say that,” roared
Henry; and they all laughed
again till they were as red as
red apples.</p>

<p>“I declare—well then—but
people say they don’t see
how poor Mrs. White will be
able to get through the winter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
They say the times are
very hard, and that she can’t
get any work.”</p>

<p>“But where is that smart
son of hers?”</p>

<p>“O, he earns lots of money;
but then the poor folks don’t
buy so many papers in hard
times. He has got lots of
brothers and sisters.”</p>

<p>“How many?—about two
hundred?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Dear me! Of <em>course</em> not,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
replied Flora, with a twist of
the head that made that heap
of pretty curls fly all over her
rosy cheeks. “He has got
two brothers, and two sisters,
besides himself.”</p>

<p>“Is he his own brother?”
laughed Henry.</p>

<p>“Of course he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“You said he had two
brothers, and two sisters, <em>besides
himself</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, you city boys are so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
very proper!” said Flora, with
a pout of her cherry lips. “I
mean that his mother has two
boys and two girls besides
David.”</p>

<p>“O, then David is a girl,”
cried Henry.</p>

<p>“How particular you are!”
said Flora, with another pout.
“Won’t you please to say it
for me?”</p>

<p>“You mean that she has
four children besides David.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>“That is just what I mean,”
added Flora, who was pleased
to have the matter settled.
“She can’t take care of them
all this winter, and something
must be done to help
her.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there an almshouse
in Riverdale?” asked Henry.</p>

<p>“Why, she don’t want to go
to the almshouse. How would
you like to go to the almshouse,
Henry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
“I shouldn’t like it; but I
am not a pauper.”</p>

<p>“What’s a pauper?” asked
Flora.</p>

<p>“Why, a poor person that
has to be taken care of by the
town or city.”</p>

<p>“You may be a pauper one
of these days.”</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to be sent
off to the almshouse, if you
were?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
“I don’t know but I should.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. White don’t,
any way. And I am going
to do something to help her.”</p>

<p>“You! what can you do?”
sneered Henry.</p>

<p>“I have got lots of money.
I have got a savings bank,
and it is almost full. I am
going to buy a lot of things
to-night—a barrel of flour,
some sugar, some tea, some
coffee, some potatoes, and—O,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
lots of things! I am going
to get father to let me have
a horse and wagon, and to-morrow
morning we will all
go over to Mrs. White’s with
the things.”</p>

<p>“That will be first rate,
Flora,” said Frank. “She
shall have all my money, too,
and I’ve got more than you
have.”</p>

<p>“You are real good, Frank,”
replied Flora. “We can buy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
ever so many things. Won’t
we have a nice time! And
won’t Mrs. White be glad, and
won’t she be surprised when
we take the things in to her!”</p>

<p>“Won’t she, though!”</p>

<p>“We must send her a load
of wood too. Don’t you want
to give something, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should like to, but
I haven’t got much to give.”</p>

<p>“I have got a dollar, and
so have you,” said Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>“I don’t want to give all
of it. I want to buy something
for myself.”</p>

<p>“I will give all of mine.”</p>

<p>“I will give half a dollar,”
added Henry.</p>

<p>Then Frank and Flora took
their money boxes out of a
drawer in the play room.
They were little wooden boxes
with holes in the top to slip
the money through. Each of
them had a key, and the savings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
banks were emptied upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Henry helped Flora count
her money, and they found
there was two dollars and
seventy cents. Frank’s box
had contained three dollars
and twenty cents. The two
cousins gave a dollar and a
half; and the whole sum for
the poor widow was seven
dollars and forty cents.</p>

<p>To the children this was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
great sum of money, and they
thought it would pay all of
Mrs. White’s expenses for the
winter. Frank was chosen to
keep the funds, and he put
them into one of the boxes.
Then Flora said they had
better go down and tell her
father all about the plan, and
he would show them how to
go to work.</p>

<p>Flora was so delighted, she
could not walk, but went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
dancing down the stairs and
through the entries. She kept
thinking all the time how glad
the poor widow would be to
see the things, and how happy
they would all be when they
carried them to her.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lee were in
the sitting room when the
party rushed through the
entry. They saw that “something
was in the wind,” and
Mr. Lee threw down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
newspaper which the little
merchant had just brought to
him, and Mrs. Lee stopped
sewing. The children came
just as though the house was
on fire, and they would all be
burnt to death if they did not
run as fast as ever they could.</p>

<p>“Father!” shouted Flora,
as she bolted into the room,
followed by the others.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, my
dear? Have you hurt you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“O, no, father. I’ve got something
to tell you—something
first rate; and I want you to
help me—I mean we—for
we are all going to do it.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?
I should think you meant to
set the river afire!”</p>

<p>“O, no, nothing of that kind,
father. We are going to give
a Christmas present to Mrs.
White. You know she is
very poor, and has a hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
time to take care of all her
family.”</p>

<p>“She has, indeed, my child.”</p>

<p>“We have put all our
money together, and we are
going to buy a load of wood,
a barrel of flour, lots of potatoes,
and meat, and coffee, and
tea, sugar, and—and—pepper,
and salt, and <span class="lock">mustard——”</span></p>

<p>“Stop, stop, my child! You
will have a fit if you run on
in this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Her father and mother, and
the children, all laughed to
hear Flora talk so fast, and
add such things as pepper
and mustard to her list. I
suppose they thought the poor
widow could get along very
well without such things as
these.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee said he liked the
plan, and that he would take
the money and buy such
things as he thought Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
White needed. He promised
to have every thing ready for
them to start at eight o’clock
the next morning.</p>

<p>While the children were at
tea, the parlor doors were unlocked,
and the room lighted.
One end was occupied by a
beautiful Christmas tree, which
was covered all over with candles
and pretty things.</p>

<p>When Flora and Frank and
their cousins entered the parlor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
they were very much surprised,
for none of them had
ever seen any thing so brilliant
before, and they all passed a
merry Christmas Eve.</p>

<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children were up bright
and early at Mr. Lee’s on
Christmas morning. They had
expected a visit from Santa
Claus during the night, and
the stockings had all been
left so that he could easily
find them.</p>

<p>Truly Santa Claus had been
kind to them, for the stockings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
were not only well filled, but
a table was also covered all
over with fine things. There
were all kinds of playthings,
and books, and games, and
pictures.</p>

<p>The parents of Frank and
Flora were rich, and could
afford to give them a great
many nice things. I don’t
think they cared so much for
playthings as some children
I have seen. They had so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
many of them that they did
not value them as some poorer
children would have done.</p>

<p>After Flora had emptied
her stocking, and gathered
up the books, games, and pictures
that belonged to her, she
told Frank she wished she had
all the money they cost, so
that she could give it to poor
Mrs. White.</p>

<p>Frank said he wished he
had the money for his presents,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
for he was sure it would
make the poor widow happier
than the things would him.
But they were both very
grateful to their parents for
thinking of them,—for they
knew that Santa Claus was
only another name for father
and mother.</p>

<p>All the little boys and girls
don’t know this. Emma—that
is one of my little girls—asked
me if I did not take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
out the register, so that Santa
Claus could get into the room,
and fill up her stocking. But
she is only four years old.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas” rang
through the house till breakfast
was over, and then the
children were in a great
hurry to make the visit to
Mrs. White. Mr. Lee had
gone out early in the morning,
and they were all sure that he
would do every thing right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
At eight o’clock, Mrs. Lee
had bundled up the children
in their warm hoods and
cloaks, ready for a start.
Then they wanted to be off
at once, and Flora’s mother
could hardly keep her from
running out in the cold, before
the things were ready.</p>

<p>I suppose my readers all
know that in the city, or any
where, when they want to
have a great time, they get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
up a procession, and march
through the streets. They
sometimes have wagons, and
chariots, and carriages.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee, who was very glad
to find that the children were
so kind as to remember the
poor widow on Christmas,
meant to surprise them. So
he got up a kind of procession.
Perhaps you will think
it was a queer procession;
but it pleased the children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
ever so much, and Flora was
almost wild with delight.</p>

<p>While they were looking
out the window, they saw Mr.
Lee drive up with the carryall.
He came very slowly, for behind
him was a wagon with a
cord of wood on it, drawn by
two yokes of oxen. Then
came a cart with two barrels
of potatoes, a barrel of flour,
and a barrel of apples on it.
Behind this was a wagon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
loaded with buckets of sugar,
rice, coffee, with packages of
tea, salt, and other groceries;
a ham, a turkey, a keg of salt
pork; and a great many other
things.</p>

<p>Flora screamed with delight
when she saw this procession.
It was more grand than an
army of soldiers, and she
thought she would rather go
in it than be the Queen of
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Frank was pleased, and so
were the two city cousins.
Henry even went so far as to
wish he had given all his
money, instead of half of it.</p>

<p>The children all bolted out
at the front door, and Mr. Lee
helped them into the carryall.</p>

<p>“This is first rate, father,”
said Flora. “Won’t Mrs. White
be surprised!”</p>

<p>“I think she will be,” replied
Mr. Lee. “She will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
have good reason to be surprised.”</p>

<p>“I hope you have got lots
of things.”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Did you spend all the
money?”</p>

<p>“Yes; every cent of it, my
child.”</p>

<p>“And more too,” said Henry,
as he looked back upon
the procession of “goodies.”</p>

<p>“Did you, father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“I thought I would add a
little to your gift,” said Mr.
Lee, with a smile.</p>

<p>“How kind you are, father!”</p>

<p>“But all the things shall be
called the children’s Christmas
gift.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee got into the carriage,
and told the drivers
of the wagons to follow him.
The two horses were wide
awake. They did not want
to wait for the slow oxen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
but Mr. Lee made them, for
he wanted the procession to
keep together.</p>

<p>When the procession had
got about half way to Mrs.
White’s house, a man covered
with dirt and rags stopped the
carriage. He said he was very
poor, and had not eaten any
thing since the morning before.</p>

<p>“Poor man!” said Flora.
“Do give him something,
father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
“Bless you, little miss!
Your father is too kind to
refuse me,” said the man.</p>

<p>“I can’t do any thing for
you,” said Mr. Lee, firmly.</p>

<p>“Do, father,” added Flora.</p>

<p>“Any small change, to buy
me something to eat,” said the
man, in pleading tones.</p>

<p>“If you are hungry, go to
my house, and my wife will
feed you,” replied Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
matter of a few cents?”
begged the man.</p>

<p>“Not a cent.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Henry. “I
don’t want the poor man to
go hungry;” and he threw
him a ten-cent piece.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my little
man!” said the beggar, as he
picked up the money. “May
you never want for a meal of
victuals!”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee started his horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
and the procession again
moved on. Flora wondered
that her father should deny
the poor man. She pitied him
very much, when he said he
had eaten nothing since the
morning before. She thought
what a dreadful thing it was
to be hungry, and have nothing
to eat.</p>

<p>She wanted to cry, she felt
so badly, and she thought her
father was very hard not to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
give him a little money when
he needed it so much. If she
had only had some money, she
would have given him the
whole of it.</p>

<p>“You did very wrong,
Henry,” said Mr. Lee, when
they had gone a little way
farther.</p>

<p>“Wrong, sir?” replied Henry.
“Why, didn’t the man
say he had eaten nothing for
a whole day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
“That may be, and it may
not be.”</p>

<p>“But I know he was hungry
by the looks of him,” said
Flora.</p>

<p>“Those who have any thing
to give away ought to be very
careful to whom they give it.
The man looked like a drunkard.
Very likely he will spend
the money you gave him,
Henry, for liquor. It is not
charity to give a man rum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
“Do you think he is a bad
man, father?” asked Flora.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he is.
I told him to go to the house,
and your mother would give
him something to eat. You
saw that he wanted money
more than food. I am afraid,
Henry, your money will do
him more hurt than good.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, uncle.”</p>

<p>“It is not charity to give
money to such persons. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
you have any thing to give,
you ought to use a great deal
of care. We should visit the
poor, and find out about them.”</p>

<p>“We know Mrs. White is
good,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“We do; and we may give
to her without fear.”</p>

<p>The children had learned a
new lesson about giving—a
lesson which every body ought
to learn.

<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. White</span>, the poor widow,
had been able to get along
very well while she could obtain
work, and while David,
her oldest son, could sell
plenty of newspapers. But it
was very hard times, and there
was not much work to be
done; so the poor had to get
along as well as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Many of the mills had
ceased to work because the
times were so hard, and therefore
the men who had bought
a paper every day could not
afford to do so now. David
lost about one half of his trade.
His mother earned very little,
and she had no idea how she
should be able to get through
the hard winter.</p>

<p>On that bright, cold Christmas
morning, the poor widow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
thought how happy the rich
must be, who had plenty to
eat, and plenty of coal to keep
them warm. She thought of
the future, and feared she
should be obliged to ask the
town to help her. She did not
want to do this, but she could
not think of letting her children
suffer for the want of food, or
shiver in the cold.</p>

<p>While she was thinking of
these things, Mr. Lee drove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
up to the front door, and the
children all got out of the
carryall. Mrs. White wondered
what they had come
for, and she was still more
surprised when she saw the
great load of wood, the cart
with the barrels, and the wagon
full of buckets and bundles.</p>

<p>She did not know what to
make of it, for she did not
understand that all these
things were for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>“I wish you a merry Christmas!”
shouted Flora, as she
rushed into the kitchen, where
Mrs. White and the children
were.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Flora,”
replied Mrs. White. “May you
live to see a great many, and all
of them happy as the present.”</p>

<p>All the rest of the children
wished the poor widow and
all her family a merry Christmas.
Flora capered about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the room, almost beside herself
with joy.</p>

<p>“We have brought you lots
of good things, Mrs. White,”
said she, when the children
had all wished the family a
merry Christmas. “We put
all our money together, and
bought you a load of wood,
some flour, and potatoes, and
apples, and tea, and sugar, and
pepper, and salt, and mustard,
<span class="lock">and——”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“That will do, Flora,” said
her father. “Mrs. White will
soon find out what you have
brought.”</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you
all, children, for thinking of
me. May God reward you for
your kindness!” replied Mrs.
White, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“We wanted to make it a
happy day for you, and David,
and the rest of the children,”
added Flora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
“It will be the happiest day
I have seen for a month,” said
Mrs. White. “I was thinking
this very morning what would
become of us; but you have
filled my home with plenty.
I shall never forget you, children.”</p>

<p>Then Flora danced three or
four times round the room, for
she was so happy she could
not keep still. I hope my
readers have all found out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
that “it is more blessed to
give than to receive.” I am
sure Flora and Frank were
quite as happy as the poor
widow—though her fears
about her children being cold
and hungry had suddenly been
driven away.</p>

<p>She felt that God had heard
her prayers, and made these
children the agents of his
bounty. Her eyes were full
of tears, but they were tears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
of joy. As she heard the rattling
of the sticks of wood
which the men were throwing
from the wagon, it seemed
like sweet music to her ears.
Then the barrels were rolled
into the kitchen, the buckets
placed in the closet, and the
bundles on the table, so that
the room looked just as though
she had set up a store.</p>

<p>“These things are the Christmas
gift of the children,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Mr. Lee, when the articles had
all been brought into the house.
“They got up the affair themselves,
without my knowledge.
No one told them to do it;
and I am sure they will all
remember to-day as one of
the happiest days of their
lives.”</p>

<p>“They are very kind; and
I shall think of them and
pray for them as long as I
live,” replied Mrs. White. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
was afraid this morning that
we should all have to go to
the poorhouse. I spoke to
David about it, and the poor
boy cried as though his heart
would break. He is a very
tender-hearted child.”</p>

<p>“I hope I shall be able to
pay you for all these things
some time,” said David.</p>

<p>“O, we don’t want any pay,”
exclaimed Flora. “That would
spoil every thing. This is our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Christmas gift, David. You
wouldn’t pay for a gift—would
you, David?”</p>

<p>“You are very good, and
I hope I shall be able to do
something for you one of these
days, Flora,” replied David.
“You are very rich, and we
are very poor, so that we
can’t do much for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“What can I do?”</p>

<p>“You can love us; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
that is all we want—isn’t it,
father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child; and we
must always deserve their
love. We may yet be poor,
and David may yet be very
rich.”</p>

<p>“When he is, David will be
good to us, I know. Wouldn’t
it be funny, if we should get
poor, and David should bring us
a load of wood, some potatoes,
flour, tea, sugar, and apples?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
“And mustard and pepper,”
added Henry, laughing.</p>

<p>“It would not be very funny
for us, but I know we should
be thankful to him,” replied
Mr. Lee, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, David, when things
change, you shall do for us
what we have done for you,
and then it will be all square.”</p>

<p>“I hope you never will be
poor, but if you are, I will give
you every thing I have,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
David, in a feeling and earnest
tone.</p>

<p>The children stopped nearly
an hour at the little black cottage;
but they were so happy,
it seemed like a palace to them.
They had all felt the luxury of
doing good. The plenty they
had carried to the home of the
poor family filled their own
hearts with plenty—with love
and peace.</p>

<p>Before they went away, Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Lee gave Mrs. White money
enough to buy some warm
clothes for all the children, and
for herself. She had nothing
more to fear from the cold
winter and hard times; and
she hoped in the spring to be
able to take care of her family
herself.</p>

<p>The party, so happy they
could hardly keep from shouting,
bade the family good by,
and started for home. As they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
passed through the village,
they saw, in front of a store
where rum was sold, two men
fighting. They were soon
parted by some people, and
Henry saw that one of them
was the man to whom he had
given the money.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee said he had been
drinking. He stopped the
horses, and asked a gentleman
who the man was. He was
told that he was a poor man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
who spent all he could earn
for liquor, and that he had
just taken enough to make
him ugly, so that he wanted
to fight.</p>

<p>“You see what good your
money has done, Henry,” said
Mr. Lee, as he started the
horses.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it has done more
harm than good. I will never
give money again, unless I am
pretty sure that it will do good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
“That is a good lesson for
you to learn. It is not charity
to give to every one that asks
us.”</p>

<p>In a little while the party
reached Mr. Lee’s house, where
they had a nice time all the
rest of the day—a better time,
I am sure, for having begun
the day with a good deed.</p>
